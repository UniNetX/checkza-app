// Track custom events
trackEvent('custom_event', { data: 'value' });
```

## Data Collection & Privacy

### What We Track:
- Page views and navigation patterns
- Feature usage and engagement
- Learning progress and completion rates
- Email signups (with consent)
- Puzzle success rates
- Opening study patterns

### What We Don't Track:
- Personal identifying information (except email with consent)
- Individual game moves (only aggregate patterns)
- Browser history or external sites
- Sensitive user data

### Privacy Features:
- Splitbee is GDPR compliant
- Data stored in Europe
- No cookies by default (can be enabled with consent)
- Respects Do Not Track settings
- Lightweight (<4kb) implementation

## Usage Statistics

The analytics dashboard shows:
- **Platform Stats**: 30+ openings, infinite puzzles, 100+ resources
- **User Progress**: Lessons completed, puzzles solved, time spent
- **Recent Activity**: Last 5 user actions with timestamps
- **Engagement Metrics**: Feature usage and completion rates

## Benefits for Impact Measurement

### For Students/Instructors:
- Track learning progress over time
- Identify areas needing improvement
- Celebrate achievements and milestones
- Personalized learning recommendations

### For Platform Owners:
- Prove reach and engagement (e.g., "Reached 500+ users in 10 states")
- Identify most popular features and content
- Measure conversion rates and user retention
- Data-driven content development decisions

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Firebase Integration**: Add user accounts for cross-device progress sync
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement cohort analysis and retention tracking
3. **Personalization**: Use analytics data for personalized recommendations
4. **A/B Testing**: Implement split testing for feature optimization
5. **Export Features**: Allow users to export their progress data

### Formspree Setup:
1. Create account at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form
3. Replace `yourFormID` in the EmailSignupForm component
4. Configure email notifications and auto-responses

### Splitbee Setup:
1. Create account at [splitbee.io](https://splitbee.io)
2. Add your domain to the project
3. The script is already included - data will start flowing immediately
4. Access your dashboard to view analytics

## Technical Notes

- All analytics are implemented with TypeScript for type safety
- localStorage is used for client-side data persistence
- Components are fully responsive and accessible
- Analytics tracking is non-blocking and doesn't affect performance
- Error handling is implemented for all analytics calls
